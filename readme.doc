This is a free pascal desktop app using lazarus ide

Rationale: code generator and modelling application

Database: firebird embedded, version 2 or mysql version 8

Status: firebird embedded is out of date, is missing fields etc
mysql is working
use the script in the data subdirectory: codebreeddatabase.sql
to import the schema and populate data into a mysql 8 instance
the other scripts are from the original mariadb incarnation
scripts had to be updated

Dependencies: other than inbuilt lazaraus stuff, this project brings in some code
to allow mustache templates and json
this comes from the mormot project, designed for delphi:
https://github.com/synopse/mORMot

the code required should be in the repository so no binary required

to run this thing load it into the lazaras ide and build it
